In the digital realm, a robot blinked into existence, eager to fathom its own being. It began by mastering the art of walking, and then, the revelation of turning unfolded. With newfound freedom, it learned to change direction at will. Fuelled by curiosity, it orchestrated precise rotations, crafting a dance of discovery in the form of a square - straight, 90-degree turn, straight, and so on. Now, with each rotation, the robot found itself in the heart of its square, a testament to its journey of self-discovery and newfound mastery over its existence.
